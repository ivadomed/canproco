# T2w CSA

This folder contains bash scripts used for calculation of cross-sectional area (CSA) at C2-C3 vertebral levels from 
T2w images for CanProCo and spine-generic dataset. Both scripts can be run using SCT wrapper `sct_run_batch`.

The folder also contains python script used for figure creation (rainplot, scatter plot with linear fit) and statistics 
computation (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis H-test, partial correlation).
